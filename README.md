# back-end-basic

This is my back-end application on express
without some client and databases(using json file for save data localy :3)
and for more comfortable you can use `Postman`

> For start use my application u need run this command after clone:

```
npm i
npm start
```
`npm start` this script run comand `nodemon --experimental-json-modules index.js`, if you wanna deploy this, you need create script with `npm --experimental-json-modules index.js` command

> If you wanna use other port, althow i wrote `3000` by default, if this env is not defined, you can create `.env` file in root folder(back-end-basic)
> and write `PORT=YOUR_PORT_NUMBER` or just hardcode the `const PORT` in `index.js` :)
